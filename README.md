Frogger-clone game
===============================

You have to get a bath. Try to jump in the water as many times as possible without getting stinked up by the stink bugs.

Cheat your way through visualising collision circles, freezing enemies, enlarging the map, reducing enemies.

To try out the game, simply navigate to http://ranuka-perera.github.io/FE-nanodegree-project-3.
Use the arrow keys to tavigate the player, and use the buttons below the map to access advanced functionality.
You have to reset the map if you get stinked up!
